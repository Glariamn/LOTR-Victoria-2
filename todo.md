# Basic TODOs
Some are obvious, others are not. Just a small list at the moment. It clearly should be many times longer...

## Overall
 - Truly decide on a mod name and time period
 - Figure out the random crashes (probably related to the inventions that I removed but didnt remove references)
 - Get in-game descriptions set for LOTR rather than Victorian Era
 
## Map
 - Finish up the "new" terrain, river, provinces map
 - Coastlines, Anduin river oversights along the southern Gondor shore and Cair Andros
 - Play around with colormaps
 - Decide on ownership status of Gondorian fiefdoms
 - Add horses and administrative services to appropriate provinces that have already been done
 
## Gameplay
 - Actually balance out goods, in terms of price, needs, factory inputs/outputs (amounts), starting rgos 
 - Charcoal guild
 - Goods renaming
 - Finalize poptypes plan
 - Government types
 - Ideologies
 - Tech and Inventions
 - Cultures and Pops

## GFX and GUI
 - Change the Vic2 interface to something more aesthetically pleasing
 - Search for pictures that can be used for events, decisions and terrain
 - Loadingscreen pictures
 - 3d models? (long shot)

## Others 
- Music (BFME2 for example)
