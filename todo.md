# Basic TODOs
Some are obvious, others are not. Just a smallish list at the moment. It clearly should be many times longer...

## Overall
 - Get in-game descriptions set for LOTR rather than Victorian Era
 
## Map
 - Finish up the "new" terrain, river, provinces map
 - Fix the farm/grassland issue, "pathiness" of forests
 - Remove coastal desert, add desert hill terrain, blackened textures/terrain for Mordor
 - Add terrains and textures for Mordor
 - Coastlines/small islands, Anduin river oversights along the southern Gondor shore and Cair Andros
 - Play around with colormaps
 - Set liferatings and climates
 - Add Lake Ata
 - Explore adding textures of notable places such as Minas Tirith
 
## Gameplay
 - Actually balance out goods, in terms of price, needs, factory inputs/outputs (amounts), starting rgos 
 - Pop promotion changes
 - Pop ideology/reform tendencies
 - Add ideology rebels
 - Remove fascist/communist
 - Balance reform effects, figure out how to add `minimum_wage` effect to something
 - Political Party policies
 - Tech and Inventions and tech schools
 - "Unciv" reforms?
 - Cultures and Pops
 - Rework kept vanilla decisions/events
 - Province terrains
 - Figure out 6 regions to use a continents (to reskin the vanilla ones)

## GFX and GUI
 - Update the new goods icons (horse and administrative services are probably ok)
 - Change modifier icons to LOTRy icons
 - Change the Vic2 interface to something more aesthetically pleasing
 - Search for pictures that can be used for events, decisions and terrain, generals, flags
 - 3d models/skins, both buildings and soldiers/ships? (long shot)
 - New terrain textures (with a more LOTR-esque feel)
 - Unit colors for each country (common/country_colors.txt)
 - Serf POP icon
 - Land unit icons

## Flavor
 - Haradrim Tribes/Khand/Rhun formed as a cultural union

## Others 
 - Music (BFME2 for example)
