# Basic TODOs
Some are obvious, others are not. Just a smallish list at the moment. It clearly should be many times longer...

## Overall
 - Truly decide on a time period
 - Get in-game descriptions set for LOTR rather than Victorian Era
 
## Map
 - Finish up the "new" terrain, river, provinces map
 - Coastlines, Anduin river oversights along the southern Gondor shore and Cair Andros
 - Play around with colormaps
 - Decide on ownership status of Gondorian fiefdoms
 - Set liferatings and climates
 
## Gameplay
 - Actually balance out goods, in terms of price, needs, factory inputs/outputs (amounts), starting rgos 
 - Finalize poptypes plan
 - Government types and Rebels
 - Remove vanilla ideologies
 - Tech and Inventions
 - Cultures and Pops (religion to race)
 - Reforms

## GFX and GUI
 - Update the new goods icons (horse and administrative services are probably ok)
 - Change the Vic2 interface to something more aesthetically pleasing
 - Search for pictures that can be used for events, decisions and terrain, generals, flags
 - 3d models/skins, both buildings and soldiers/ships? (long shot)
 - New terrain textures (with a more LOTR-esque feel)
 - Unit colors for each country (common/country_colors.txt)

## Others 
 - Music (BFME2 for example)
