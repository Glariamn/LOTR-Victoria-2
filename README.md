# The Third Age
A Lord of the Rings mod for Victoria 2

## Installation Instructions
1. Download the mod by clicking the green Code button, then Download ZIP.
2. Extract the folder to your game directory. If you use Steam, the folder is mostly likely `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\commmon\Victoria 2\mod`
3. Go to that folder. You should see a folder named The-Third-Age-main. Rename that folder to "TTA", without the quotation marks.
4. Go into the newly renamed TTA folder and move TTA.mod up one level to `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\commmon\Victoria 2\mod`. This file will mostly likely be identified as a movie file by your computer.
5. Launch the game. You should see Lord of the Rings as one of the options. Tick it and the mod should load.
